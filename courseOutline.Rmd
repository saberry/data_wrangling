During the next four days, we are going to cover a significant amount of data wrangling. While we will not cover every single data wrangling technique, we will cover enough that you should feel confident when tricky data situations land on you lap. With regard to data, we will be using built-in data and data from other sources for our demonstrations and exercises. You might even have some data of your own that you want to bring in to work on -- I support this 100%.
 

## Getting The Most From The Week

As previously noted, we will cover many techniques in this course. I am here merely to be your guide on this journey into the heart of data wrangling; to that end, the majority of our time will be spent working on code. After every topic is introduced, you will have the opportunity to try things out. Please take this opportunity to work through the code and experiment -- it is truly the only way to learn how to wrangle data. To borrow from Massive Attack: 

> Wrangling...wrangling...wrangling's a verb.  
> Wrangling is a doing word.

The more you interact with the code, the more you will understand how it works and how you can combine functions to make data bend to your will. Work alone, in groups, ask me for help, or anything else to play with the material -- just interact with it!

## Assessment

Throughout the day, you will be given data wrangling problems -- some of these will require code and others will not. For those that don't require code, the goal is to provide the mental map for the step you need to take to get to an end state.

Your job is to explain how to get from here:

Use these daily checks to start practicing how to build your data wrangling acumen.

These daily checks are absolutely necessary and mandatory.

While not, strictly speaking, an assessment, our last day together is going to be a hack-a-thon. You will get into groups of no more than 3 people, choose a data base from those accessed in class, cobble it into some shape, and give a five minute presentation. 

## Day 1

- Base R refresher

- Basic data operations (selecting, filtering, grouping, joining)

- Importing data

- Apply family

## Day 2

- Using tidyverse functions

- Connecting to a database from R

- Writing SQL queries in R

## Day 3

- Translating to data.table

- Dates and times

## Day 4

- Group work!
